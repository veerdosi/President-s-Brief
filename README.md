# President's Brief

## Future:

imagine waking up each morning to your own “newspaper” in a harmonious voice, tailored so precisely it feels like a dialogue between you & the world.

it pulls real-time insights from your favorite x accounts (e.g. roon is talking about malthusian subsistence farming era rn), your insta feed, podcasts, reddit threads—hell, even excerpts from books & relevant quotes. it then pushes it to you. it’s all harmonized, trends, updates, & curiosities, wrapped in your personal context, not someone else’s editorial agenda. your personal ai information agent—this is the modern “flipboard”.
